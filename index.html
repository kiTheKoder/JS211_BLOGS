    <h1> Blog Through It by kiTheKoder</h1>

    <p> <h1>Class: 2,  Mood of the day: Excited! </h1> Today we are going over how to utilize conditionals in code. 
    </br>
  </br>
    The difference between double and triple equals:
  </br>
    They check for a diferent depth of sameness. Triple equals is the strict parents that lives vicariously through her children. Double equals is stict as well but doesn't mind a few variations here or there. A single equals is just here to make sure you're alive.
  </br>
</br>

    Terminal Apps: 
  </br>They're exactly how they sound. An app that is only utilized in the terminal. Often including a plethora console.log() statements.
</br>
</br>
    User-Friendly Web Apps:
  </br>
    Include descriptions for all users that may have hard times reading your app. Also try to make sure that all input and output sections are distinct and large enough to fit all users. 
  </br>
</br>
    Fave HTML5 Features:
  </br>
    I love that I am able to hard-code CSS right into my .html file. I use it for standard or one-off styles that I don't need to call from CSS. 
  </br>
</br>
    Structuring CSS and JS:
  </br>
    I try to use industry standard practices throughout all of my coding languages as I learn them One way is formatting my JS functions on each line. I personally prefer to separate my objects by 1 line.
  </p>

    <p> <h1>Class:4,  Mood of the day: Still excited! </h1> 

      What's been hard ?
    </br>
      I find that understanding how talk to my computer (or any) can be complicated. Translating a simple process into small bits of code (especially functions) can be daunting.
    </br>
  </br>
      Use Strict:
    </br>
      Allows code be executed in strict mode. It does however stop some normal coding practices from being used. 
    </br></br>
      Function Hoisting:

      Moving functions to the code body to render before the function is declared. 
    </br></br>
      ECMA:
    </br>
      Standardizes how we program so that each developer can somewhat understand (and computers) others code. 
    </br></br>
      How to maintain maintainability :
    </br>
      I try to break my code down into smaller functions that can be called within a larger function for a soution. I also try to limit how many paramters I need for my code to work.
   </p>

    <p> <h1>Class:6,  Mood of the day: WOOOOW </h1> 
    
      What are we learning today ?
    </br>
      Using data type: Object Literals
    </br></br>
    What's the difference between: function Person(){}, var person = Person(), and var person = new Person()?</br>
      function Person() takes in an arguments and then does something with the data. </br>
      var Person = Person()
       returns the data from that function and stores it's value.</br>
       var person = new Person() saves new data from the functipn that is called.
  </br></br>
      Attribute vs Property:
    </br>
      A property belongs to the DOM and comes with default values that can be utilized to manipulate and/or access data within that object. 
      An attribute belongs to HTML and is utilized within that file. It is not automatically updated within the DOM.
    </br></br>
    What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?
  </br>
  We use loops to iterate or loop through elements in an array. Then we can choose what data to extract and how we operate on that data. 

    </p>

    <p> <h1>Class:8,  Mood of the day: Is it hot in here or it's just me ? </h1> 
      <h3>Let's get personal, shall we?</h3>
      As we delve deeper into the world of coding I can feel my brain being stretched from all sides. I can feel my capacities being exceeded. I can feel the pressure from myself to be the absolute best closing in on me. Where is the light you might ask ? It is in the dier need to succeed. In that need, I can find my will and through my will I find myself breaking self-placed limits. And so there is light still. I find myself asking more and more, whole-heartedly, is there anything I can't do ? If I continue to arrive at impenetrable walls and break through them, how impenetrable are they? Were they always so weak or am I getting stronger ? Or was it simply my perception that accepted these things as walls and so it came to be? Below is a function to be called in the Program which is your mind. Feel free to upload it.
    </br></br>
    
    Perception Is Reality App
  </br></br>
        perception;</br>
        let newMindset = "positive";</br>
        let oldMindset = "negative";</br></br>
        function growth(perception)=></br>
        {if (perception === oldMindset){
          perception = newMindset</br>
        };</br>
        return perception</br>
      }</br></br>

      forEach vs map:
    </br>
    One important difference is that forEach iterates an array but map can iterate an array and then return the desired result.
  </br></br>

  Event bubbling:</br>

  Example: A parent element and it's child are passed an eventListener. It is read from the inner most element outward until reaching a parent. 
</br></br>
 What is a high order function by definition ?</br>
  A high order function is a function that calls upon other functions to comlete a program.</br></br>

  Template Literal:</br></br>
  A cool template literal trick is to declare multiline strings. </br>
  EX: </br></br>
  let text =</br>
`Today is</br>
the day</br>
pass 211</br>
and move on !`;</br></br>

Associative Arrays:</br>
Associative arrays have strings for keys. They are dynamic (meaning they possess the ability to change conistently as the user interacts with the app) in nature. However, they do not possess the attributes nor methods of an array, as they are now objects (It's screaming "Plese objectify me!")</br></br>
  
   NEVER USE NEW ARRAY</br>
   Why Kiana ? Is it that serious ? YES! *clears throat* Put simply, it's just unecessary and slow. Declaring arrays the standard way helps your code to compile faster and saves you a couple of well-needed keystrokes. And much like Texas weather... it's unpredictable for reasons unknown to the average person(devs aren't average but follow me here..). So save yourself a headache and delete it from your mind completely.
</p>

</br></br>

  <h1>Class: 10 </br> Mood of the day: "Life is tough but so am I ?" or "Life is tough and then you die ?" Ask me after coffee. </h1>
</br>
Today we learned more about the extends keyword. "It  is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class." These means that inheritance can be manipulated freely in programs. The below example was provided: Here the 'AcaStudent' inherits from the 'Human' parent class. 
</br></br>
EX:</br>
class AcaStudent extends Human </br>
{</br>
   constructor(codingLanguage, name, height, weight, dob)</br>{</br>
    super(name, height, weight, dob);</br>
    this.codingLanguage = codingLanguage;
  </br>}</br>
  greeting() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name + "! I am learning how to code!");</br>
  }</br>
} </br></br>

Arrow Gunction use cases:</br>
The ole' </br>
functionName() => {}</br></br>
You've seen it, heard of it, used and abused it. But do you get it ? </br></br>
*clears throat*</br></br>
Allow me to developersplain myself, my name is arrow function ! And I make code more readable. If a computer had a diet, I'd be more eatable (I'm a snack!) And I'm shorthand baby. Implement me cause devs are lazy ! (I'm free!) Can't bind me to this ! But if you really need to, use inheritance. Same ole me, disregarding strict.  Don't use me for  construction, I like to chill ! Use me for map, reduce, and filter ! Arrow function be out.
</br>
I hope this can help you understand the difference in how function declarations are rendered, and some of the benefits to the new common way. 
</br></br>

Destructuring:</br>
Destructuring is the technique of extracting data from an object or array and storing the value into a new variable. For example we may extract array[0] and store it in var arrayFirstIndex.</br></br>

<p>
  <h1>Class:12</br>   Mood of the day: The bittersweet end (of 211) is upon us !</h1></br></br>
Take me off of mute!</br>

Listen, no one or thing (*cough cough* Objects) want to be muted. Unfortunately for objects and arrays.. when we say jump, they must say "How high coding master?" We'd be nowhere in life (code life people) were it not for beautiful objects and arrays. And we appreciate them ! But we mute them still. Mutable objects can be changed.. We can't do that to numbers, booleans, or strings (and other stuff too.) They'd revolt, and we'd see and uprising in the console kill rate. I believe that high order functioning and const are good ways to *kill* this problem. If you create functions that aren't interdependent and then store them all in a const function you can work around or with this issue. Depending on your outlook.</br></br>

"We must divide and conquer!" - Algorithms</br>
Algorithms that divide and conquer are really just coping mechanisms for developers/programmers. Think about it.. I didn't know how to code seemingly complex problems at first. I would think up these long slews of extremely interdependent, abusive of variables, complex code when in fact I was dealing with 3 small problems and one high order  function. Also think of all the time, speed, and mental-breakdowns you'll save by writing code that can be used for other programs or code-blocks ?</br></br>
How do insertion sort, heap sort, quick sort, and merge sort work?</br>

These are known as sorting algorithms and can be used on arrays or lists to arrange their data into the specified order. These help to find data quickly and can help resolve complex problems.
</br></br>

The Three Laws of Recursion:</br>
1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
</br>
2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
</br>
3. A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.
</br></br>
So Law 1... All you need to know is base case. A base case is a way in which an algorithm can exit it's recursive state. Think of ways we prevent our loops from going on forever.. and then apply that thinking to algorithms.</br></br>
 
Law 2 is simple enough as well. We must move or algorithm toward our base case continuously. This is called a change of state (The state of your algo is changing.) Like if I looped through the indexes of 2 arrays and looked for ===, and when found printed those indexes.. I have given my loop a way to exit it's state of looping. </br></br>
And finally... last and the least easy to explain is the law  that an algo has to call itself. In the developer world we refer to this as the narcissitic attribute of algorithms.. Just kidding. It sounded good though. 
</p>

<p>
  <h1>Class: 14</br> Mood of the day: Where did all the time go ?</h1>
  As we wrap up 211, I can't help but feel feelings of nostalgia mixed with pride. It's over, this chapter is. May we never forget to remain in a constant state of now. Cherishing both what the past brought and what the future will bring.. whilst remaining privvy to the fact that all that matters is the breath you are taking right... now. Exhale (wo)man.</br></br>

  Write about something you learned this week.</br>
  Mmmmm.. I learned that API's and I don't merge well.... get it ? Okay but seriously ?! A-P-who's ? They're libraries that do what ?</br></br>

  Load Events:</br>

  Your family is having a birthday party (an event). Do you show up on time ? Heck no, you get there after all the other people and after all the other festivities happen. After your uncle passes out from too many beers and your crazy cousin exits stage left. Well guess what, you're a free(load)e(vent)r ! Much like us, they wait for some of the other code (not all) to party(render) before they show up with a to-go plate and shallow excuses. Main disadvantage: they make for shotty and slow code. 
all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.</br></br>

Alternatives to using load include using jQuery.
</br></br>

Disadvantages of AJAX
</br>
1. Some browsers can't render when sites depend on AJAX due to certain requirements not being met (XMLHttpRequest) 
</br></br>
2. Server requests can pile up, which leads to a need for more data to be consumed.
</br></br>
Our friend JSONP:</br>
JSONP stands for JSON with Padding. This is work-around for the XMLHttpRequest. You can request an external script from another domain via JSONP. JSONP makes the request via a script tag to avoid issues with cross-domain policies.</br></br>

Oh AJAX...</br>

Ajax means Asynchronous Java Script And XML. AJAX is utilised via a browser. The browser requests data from a server. AJAX allows web pages to be updated Asynchronously.
</br></br>

Time Complexity:</br>

This refers to how fast the algorithm can be completed, or in how many steps. The less the algorithm has to do to solve a problem.. the better.
</br></br>

  Recursion again ?</br>
  Here's an official definition: "The Three Laws of Recursion
  A recursive algorithm must call itself, recursively.
  A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
  A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case."
</br></br>

LET'S TALK ABOUT ME
</br>
How's my growth you ask ? I feel as if I've unlocked a part of my brain. I am starting to be code more than create it. I think about life block by block, high function by high function. I loop through my database and consistently try to Red, Green , Refactor my programming or clear up space. Old habits, trauma and all. How'd it get so dark and deep ? I don't know. But this runs as deep as my connection to big brother Naruto. That's deep. I'm falling in love with programming, and she loves me back.
