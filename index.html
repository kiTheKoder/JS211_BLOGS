    <p> <h1>Class: 2,  Mood of the day: Excited! </h1> Today we are going over how to utilize conditionals in code. 
    </br>
  </br>
    The difference between double and triple equals:
  </br>
    They check for a diferent depth of sameness. Triple equals is the strict parents that lives vicariously through her children. Double equals is stict as well but doesn't mind a few variations here or there. A single equals is just here to make sure you're alive.
  </br>
</br>

    Terminal Apps: 
  </br>They're exactly how they sound. An app that is only utilized in the terminal. Often including a plethora console.log() statements.
</br>
</br>
    User-Friendly Web Apps:
  </br>
    Include descriptions for all users that may have hard times reading your app. Also try to make sure that all input and output sections are distinct and large enough to fit all users. 
  </br>
</br>
    Fave HTML5 Features:
  </br>
    I love that I am able to hard-code CSS right into my .html file. I use it for standard or one-off styles that I don't need to call from CSS. 
  </br>
</br>
    Structuring CSS and JS:
  </br>
    I try to use industry standard practices throughout all of my coding languages as I learn them One way is formatting my JS functions on each line. I personally prefer to separate my objects by 1 line.
  </p>

    <p> <h1>Class:4,  Mood of the day: Still excited! </h1> 

      What's been hard ?
    </br>
      I find that understanding how talk to my computer (or any) can be complicated. Translating a simple process into small bits of code (especially functions) can be daunting.
    </br>
  </br>
      Use Strict:
    </br>
      Allows code be executed in strict mode. It does however stop some normal coding practices from being used. 
    </br></br>
      Function Hoisting:

      Moving functions to the code body to render before the function is declared. 
    </br></br>
      ECMA:
    </br>
      Standardizes how we program so that each developer can somewhat understand (and computers) others code. 
    </br></br>
      How to maintain maintainability :
    </br>
      I try to break my code down into smaller functions that can be called within a larger function for a soution. I also try to limit how many paramters I need for my code to work.
   </p>

    <p> <h1>Class:6,  Mood of the day: WOOOOW </h1> 
    
      What are we learning today ?
    </br>
      Using data type: Object Literals
    </br></br>
    What's the difference between: function Person(){}, var person = Person(), and var person = new Person()?</br>
      function Person() takes in an arguments and then does something with the data. </br>
      var Person = Person()
       returns the data from that function and stores it's value.</br>
       var person = new Person() saves new data from the functipn that is called.
  </br></br>
      Attribute vs Property:
    </br>
      A property belongs to the DOM and comes with default values that can be utilized to manipulate and/or access data within that object. 
      An attribute belongs to HTML and is utilized within that file. It is not automatically updated within the DOM.
    </br></br>
    What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?
  </br>
  We use loops to iterate or loop through elements in an array. Then we can choose what data to extract and how we operate on that data. 

    </p>

    <p> <h1>Class:8,  Mood of the day: Is it hot in here or it's just me ? </h1> 
      <h3>Let's get personal, shall we?</h3>
      As we delve deeper into the world of coding I can feel my brain being stretched from all sides. I can feel my capacities being exceeded. I can feel the pressure from myself to be the absolute best closing in on me. Where is the light you might ask ? It is in the dier need to succeed. In that need, I can find my will and through my will I find myself breaking self-placed limits. And so there is light still. I find myself asking more and more, whole-heartedly, is there anything I can't do ? If I continue to arrive at impenetrable walls and break through them, how impenetrable are they? Were they always so weak or am I getting stronger ? Or was it simply my perception that accepted these things as walls and so it came to be? Below is a function to be called in the Program which is your mind. Feel free to upload it.
    </br></br>
    
    Perception Is Reality App
  </br></br>
        perception;</br>
        let newMindset = "positive";</br>
        let oldMindset = "negative";</br></br>
        function growth(perception)=></br>
        {if (perception === oldMindset){
          perception = newMindset</br>
        };</br>
        return perception</br>
      }</br></br>

      forEach vs map:
    </br>
    One important difference is that forEach iterates an array but map can iterate an array and then return the desired result.
  </br></br>

  Event bubbling:</br>

  Example: A parent element and it's child are passed an eventListener. It is read from the inner most element outward until reaching a parent. 
</br></br>
 What is a high order function by definition ?</br>
  A high order function is a function that calls upon other functions to comlete a program.</br></br>

  Template Literal:</br></br>
  A cool template literal trick is to declare multiline strings. </br>
  EX: </br></br>
  let text =</br>
`Today is</br>
the day</br>
pass 211</br>
and move on !`;</br></br>

Associative Arrays:</br>
Associative arrays have strings for keys. They are dynamic (meaning they possess the ability to change conistently as the user interacts with the app) in nature. However, they do not possess the attributes nor methods of an array, as they are now objects (It's screaming "Plese objectify me!")</br></br>
  
   NEVER USE NEW ARRAY</br>
   Why Kiana ? Is it that serious ? YES! *clears throat* Put simply, it's just unecessary and slow. Declaring arrays the standard way helps your code to compile faster and saves you a couple of well-needed keystrokes. And much like Texas weather... it's unpredictable for reasons unknown to the average person(devs aren't average but follow me here..). So save yourself a headache and delete it from your mind completely.
</p>

  <h1>Class: 10 </br> Mood of the day: "Life is tough but so am I ?" or "Life is tough and then you die ?" Ask me after coffee. </h1>
</br>
Today we learned more about the extends keyword. "It  is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class." These means that inheritance can be manipulated freely in programs. The below example was provided: Here the 'AcaStudent' inherits from the 'Human' parent class. 
</br></br>
EX:</br>
class AcaStudent extends Human </br>
{</br>
   constructor(codingLanguage, name, height, weight, dob)</br>{</br>
    super(name, height, weight, dob);</br>
    this.codingLanguage = codingLanguage;
  </br>}</br>
  greeting() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name + "! I am learning how to code!");</br>
  }</br>
} </br></br>

Arrow Gunction use cases:</br>
The ole' </br>
functionName() => {}</br></br>
You've seen it, heard of it, used and abused it. But do you get it ? </br></br>
*clears throat*</br></br>
Allow me to developersplain myself, my name is arrow function ! And I make code more readable. If a computer had a diet, I'd be more eatable (I'm a snack!) And I'm shorthand baby. Implement me cause devs are lazy ! (I'm free!) Can't bind me to this ! But if you really need to, use inheritance. Same ole me, disregarding strict.  Don't use me for  construction, I like to chill ! Use me for map, reduce, and filter ! Arrow function be out.
</br>
I hope this can help you understand the difference in how function declarations are rendered, and some of the benefits to the new common way. 
</br></br>

Destructuring:</br>
Destructuring is the technique of extracting data from an object or array and storing the value into a new variable. For example we may extract array[0] and store it in var arrayFirstIndex.</br></br>
